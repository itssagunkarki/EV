Using plotly:

1. Sankey diagram:
left side is current vehicles (there could be 6, so you'll have to set vehicle = vehicle 1 code, then append vehicle = vehicle2 code, vehicle=vehicle 3 code, etc.
right side is stated preference (SP) choice: there are 6 responses for each person, so you'd have to append 6 records for each with stated preference response = response 1, then resonse 2, then response 3, etc.
middle? We could also include the vehicle they say they will buy next as a column in the middle

left side: current vehicle: veh_type 1 - 6
right side: stated preference choice sp 1 - 6
middle: next vehicle choice: 

2. Next vehicle choice by household size - possibly as a stacked bar chart
x axis = household size (describe the household size range 1-3, 3-6)
y axis = type of vehicle (gas, hybrid, electric, etc.)

3. Off-road driving frequency by occupation?
Q 394
x axis = occupation types
y axis = frequency of off-road driving

4. Off-road driving frequency by next vehicle purchase type

5. Time to next vehicle purchase and next vehicle fuel type
line chart
Q 15
x axis = time to next vehicle purchase
y axis = population 

multiple lines: each representing a different vehicle fuel types

6. Charging at residence as pie chart or bar chart
